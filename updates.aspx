            Note: a) Most of work is done only validation and few other changes need to be done  plus we are still testing for various bugs which may take a while<br />
             &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  b)If page is loading very slow then it is due to either the internet speed or low end server that it is hosted on in real local server it works smoothly.
			 
			 
			 <h2>Send all the errors/bugs you see for now we'll solve it one by one.</h2>
